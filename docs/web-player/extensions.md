# Extensions

Every player interaction is reflected in the [redux store](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/Store.html).
Accessing the players store enables the full control of the player while running. Reacting to player events can be done by attatching to the latest action. 

A full list of available types can be found in the [@podlove/player-actions](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-ui/blob/development/packages/player/actions/types.js) package.
